Email Templates
===============

Here are dozens of email templates for a variety of themes and layouts that you can use. These templates can be sent through a variety of email products including Spectate. These templates can also be integrated into Cascade Server and published out as static pages to provide web versions of each. Any emails sent through Spectate will automatically have a unique version hosted for every recipient.

Most of these templates are built using inline CSS to work across a number of different devices and mail clients. Some of these templates use a `<style>` tag to define the styles. For those templates, you should determine if the product you're using to send the emails automatically uses a CSS Inliner or not. There are many free websites that will convert your template in seconds if needed.

We've provided a number of templates that should work out of the box. We've also included a Spectate-ready versions (look for the `-spct8` filenames) that use some basic personalization tokens.

Images required for templates can be uploaded into Spectate (and potentially other email products) for easy hosting of necessary image files.
