<h2>A tropical depression that formed in the southern Caribbean Wednesday could become Tropical Storm Nate later today</h2>
<p>A tropical depression that formed in the southern Caribbean Wednesday could become Tropical Storm Nate later today, on track to hit the Gulf Coast, and possibly Florida, as a hurricane by the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Bulleted&#160;example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lorem ipsum</strong>&#160;is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of English to emphasise design elements over content. It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. It's a convenient tool for mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, eg typography, font, or layout.</li>
<li>Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by the classical author and philosopher Cicero. Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, so to deliberately render its content nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore. While&#160;<strong>lorem ipsum</strong>'s still resembles classical Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever.</li>
<li>As Cicero's text doesn't contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to mimic the typographic appearence of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.</li>
</ul>
<p>In their latest advisory, National Hurricane Center forecasters said the storm will move over warm waters and encounter light wind shear, allowing quick intensification. It&#8217;s possible sustained winds could reach 80 mph by Saturday, marking it a weak Category 1 storm as it approaches the U.S. coast.</p>
